# Feature: Observability & Errors

## Story
As a developer, I want comprehensive logging, monitoring, and error handling throughout the application, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in production.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Structured logging system (backend and frontend)
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting system
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Error boundaries in frontend
- [ ] Centralized error handling middleware
- [ ] Log aggregation and search capabilities
- [ ] Alert notifications for critical errors

## UX
Wireframe/flow: [TODO] - Error pages, loading states, monitoring dashboard

## Design & Contract
- [ ] Logging schema and format standards
- [ ] Error response format (Zod/OpenAPI)
- [ ] ADR required? [TODO] - Observability tools and practices

## Implementation
- [ ] Backend - Next.js error handling, Supabase logging, health checks
- [ ] Frontend - Next.js error boundaries, error tracking, loading states
- [ ] Feature flag - [TODO] - Determine if observability needs feature flags

## Tests
- [ ] Unit - Error handling logic, logging utilities
- [ ] Integration - Error scenarios, health check endpoints (Next.js API)
- [ ] Contract - Error response schema validation (Zod)
- [ ] E2E - Error flow testing, monitoring verification

## Deployment
- [ ] PR - Observability implementation
- [ ] CI - Observability tests and monitoring setup (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Preview - Vercel preview with observability testing
- [ ] Staged rollout - [TODO] - Observability rollout strategy

## Closure
- [ ] KPI checked - [TODO] - Error rates, response times, uptime
- [ ] Flag removed - [TODO] - If feature flags were used
- [ ] Docs updated - Monitoring and debugging documentation
