# Feature: Design System & UI Skeleton

## Story
As a user, I want a consistent and polished user interface with proper loading states and error handling, so that I can navigate the application smoothly and understand what's happening at all times.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design system with consistent themes and colors
- [ ] Reusable UI components (buttons, forms, inputs, cards)
- [ ] Navigation system and layout structure
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Empty states for lists and data
- [ ] Error states with helpful messages

- [ ] CI - UI tests and visual regression testing (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Preview - Vercel preview with design system showcase
- [ ] Staged rollout - [TODO] - Design system rollout strategy

## Closure
