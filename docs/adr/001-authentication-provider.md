# ADR-001: Authentication Provider Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application requires a robust authentication system with the following requirements:
- User registration and login with email/password
- Password reset functionality
- Session management with refresh tokens
- Row Level Security (RLS) integration
- Organization/workspace management
- Role-based access control

## Decision
We have decided to use **Supabase Auth** as our primary authentication provider.

## Rationale

### Pros of Supabase Auth:
1. **Integrated Database**: Seamless integration with PostgreSQL and RLS
2. **Built-in Features**: Email/password auth, password reset, email verification
3. **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and session handling
4. **Security**: Industry-standard JWT tokens, secure by default
5. **Developer Experience**: Simple SDK, good documentation
6. **Cost-effective**: Free tier suitable for development and small scale
7. **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support out of the box

### Alternatives Considered:

#### NextAuth.js
- **Pros**: Great Next.js integration, multiple providers
- **Cons**: More complex setup, requires separate database management for user data
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complexity of RLS integration

#### Firebase Auth
- **Pros**: Mature, reliable, multiple auth methods
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, requires separate database for RLS
- **Decision**: Rejected due to database separation concerns

#### Custom Auth
- **Pros**: Full control, no vendor lock-in
- **Cons**: Security risks, maintenance overhead, time investment
- **Decision**: Rejected due to security and time constraints

## Implementation Details

### Architecture:
- **Client-side**: `@supabase/ssr` for browser client
- **Server-side**: `@supabase/ssr` for server components and API routes
- **Middleware**: Next.js middleware for route protection
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS policies

### Security Measures:
- JWT tokens with automatic refresh
- Secure cookie handling for SSR
- Row Level Security policies
- Environment variable protection
- HTTPS enforcement in production

### Integration Points:
- Next.js API routes for custom auth logic
- Database triggers for profile creation
- RLS policies for data access control
- Zod schemas for request/response validation

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Rapid development and deployment
- Built-in security best practices
- Seamless database integration
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Strong TypeScript support

### Negative:
- Vendor dependency on Supabase
- Limited customization of auth UI
- Potential migration complexity if switching providers

### Mitigation:
- Abstract auth logic behind service interfaces
- Document all auth-related configurations
- Regular backups of user data
- Monitor Supabase service status and updates

## Monitoring and Success Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Session duration and refresh patterns
- Security incident tracking
- User registration and login conversion rates
- Password reset completion rates

## Review Date
This decision will be reviewed in 6 months or when significant changes to authentication requirements occur.
